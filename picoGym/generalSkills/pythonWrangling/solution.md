Firstly, looking at the imports, the program imports the `base64` library, which is used for encoding and decoding data in Base64.

Next, the code defines usage messages (`usage_msg`) and help messages (`help_msg`) to guide users on how to use the script.

```python
usage_msg = "Usage: "+ sys.argv[0] +" (-e/-d) [file]"
help_msg = usage_msg + "\n" +\
        "Examples:\n" +\
        "  To decrypt a file named 'pole.txt', do: " +\
        "'$ python "+ sys.argv[0] +" -d pole.txt'\n"

```
These messages indicate that the script can be called with two main options: `-e` for encryption and `-d` for decryption. An example is provided for decrypting a file named `pole.txt`.

```python
elif sys.argv[1] == "-d":
    if len(sys.argv) < 4:
        sim_sala_bim = input("Please enter the password:")
    else:
        sim_sala_bim = sys.argv[3]

    ssb_b64 = base64.b64encode(sim_sala_bim.encode())
    c = Fernet(ssb_b64)

    with open(sys.argv[2], "r") as f:
        data = f.read()
        data_c = c.decrypt(data.encode())
        sys.stdout.buffer.write(data_c)
```
This section handles the decryption process. If the password is not provided as an argument, the user is prompted to enter it. The password is then encoded in Base64 and used to create a Fernet object. The specified file is opened in text mode ("r"), its content is read, decrypted, and the result is written to the standard output.

Finally, you can use the script to decrypt the flag as shown in the help message:

```
cmd : python ende.py -d flag.txt.en

Please enter the password:
```

Enter the password (contents of pw.txt), and you should obtain the flag:
